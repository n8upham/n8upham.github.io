# Nathan S. Upham, Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology

## I am a post-doc in the Dept of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, in the lab of [Walter Jetz](http://jetzlab.yale.edu/) as part of the NSF-sponsored [VertLife Terrestrial project](http://vertlife.org/).

> I study evolution, ecology, and biodiversity from a spatial and temporal perspective, integrating data from molecules (DNA), fossils, and species traits to investigate when and where groups of species originated, at what evolutionary rates, and in relation to which paleo-environmental factors.  My research is centered on mammalian evolution and has focused on unique lineages of rats and mice in the tropical Americas (guinea pigs, spiny rats, and relatives) and in North American deserts (kangaroo mice and relatives).  Using approaches from phylogenetics, biogeography, paleobiology, and population genetics, I aim to (i) uncover core dynamics of the eco-evolutionary process, and (ii) broadly communicate the results to encourage informed biodiversity conservation in the tropical and arid ecosystems where I work.
