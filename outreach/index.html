<strong>Outreach from field to classroom and museum</strong>
</h1>
<p>

<i>How we treat each other fundamentally matters.</i> The core truth of our mutuality demonstrates the need to target both structural inequalities and implicit biases, which block scientific training opportunities for Black, Indigenous, Latine, LGBTQIA+, and female scholars. Recognizing the advantages provided by my perceived position at the center of society, as an educated, white-passing, native English-speaking American male, has helped me to take responsibility for that privilege by giving more kindness and taking more risks to defend the voices of others. I take my central positionality as a challenge to do proportionately more to promote others to pursue their dreams, and to cultivate community feeling where I live and work. Action toward these goals has guided my trajectory, from doing outreach in Chicago Public Schools and at the Field Museum of Natural History, to mentoring students during my postdocs (McMaster and Yale) and now building an inclusive lab environment as an ASU faculty member.
