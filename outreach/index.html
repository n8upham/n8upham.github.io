2015. YouTube show <i>The Brain Scoop</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx6jcp9zfQ" target="_blank">features our work on the evolutionary distinctiveness of naked mole-rats</a> (now with over 50,000 views!!).
</p>
<p>
2014. Popular news story on my work with Bruce Patterson: <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/blog/naked-mole-rats-not-mole-not-rat-and-not-african-mole-rat" target="_blank">"Naked mole-rats: Not a mole, not a rat, and not an African mole-rat"</a>.

2014. <b>Upham, N. S.</b> <a href="http://www.thehumangeographic.com/vizcacha-rat/">At the edge of what we know</a>. <i>The Human Geographic</i>, issue 1 (<a href="http://www.thehumangeographic.com/" target="_blank">online multi-media magazine</a>; this is a popular article I wrote on vizcacha rat fieldwork in Argentina).
