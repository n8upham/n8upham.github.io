2017. The publication of our vizcacha rat study "Evolution of the largest mammalian genome" garners press attention from <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170712110532.htm">ScienceDaily</a>, <a href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2017/07/13/how-study-of-a-rare-rat-genome-may-relate-to-humans/">CBC Radio</a>, and a blog post from <a href="https://www.molecularecologist.com/2017/07/the-largest-mammalian-genome-is-not-polyploid/">The Molecular Ecologist</a>.
</p>
<p>
2017. The journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13183/full"><i>Evolution</i> wrote a news article</a> about our analyses of the timing and rates of species diversification in sigmodontine mice.
</p>
<p>
2015. Chilean newspaper <a href="https://www.australvaldivia.cl/impresa/2015/09/03/full/cuerpo-principal/2/">Diario Austral wrote an article</a> on our description of a new mouse, <i>Abrothrix manni</i>, from Valdivian rainforests.
