<h3><strong>Introduction</h3></strong>

Super glad that you are interested in the lab.  Please review the lab pages here and recent <a href="https://n8u.org/pubs/">publications</a> to find out more about what we do and how you could both learn from and contribute to our team.

<h3><strong>Mentoring philosophy</h3></strong>





<p>
Currently, my lab is accepting PhD student applications through the <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/phd-evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary Biology</a> program in the ASU School of Life Sciences. I also accept applications for <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/ms-biology--ms">MS in Biology</a> students.  Note that the ASU deadline is <b>1 December</b> annually for applying to these programs. There is also the "4+1" route of an accelerated MS degree if you are a current ASU undergraduate student (details of the latter program <a href="https://acceleratedmasters.asu.edu/how-apply">here</a>>).
</p>
<p>
I place a premium on curiosity, enthusiasm, research experience, analytical skills, writing ability, and creativity. If and when you decide to contact me, please take some time and write a thoughtful letter (because this is more likely to generate a thoughtful response). Please send me your CV and transcripts as appropriate. Tell me a bit about your interests, and why you’re interested in working with our group. Please understand that I may not be able to respond if you don't send these materials. Also, it bodes well if you’ve looked into a funding source or two, particularly if you’re interested in conducting dissertation work (e.g., the <a href="https://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> or <a href="https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/8-current-fulbrighters/338-phd-info-2">Fulbright program</a> depending on your citizenship). 
</p>
<p>
I tend not to accept PhD students who haven’t first earned their MS degree, but I will consider exceptional cases. If you are interested in forgoing an MS and working toward your PhD, I will prefer seeing some evidence of your ability to see something through from start to finish, preferably in the form of one or more peer-reviewed publications.
</p>
<p>
If you’re still interested in working with us after reading this far, please send me an email (<a href="mailto:nathan.upham@asu.edu">nathan[dot]upham[at]asu[dot]edu</a>). 
</p>
<p>
I'm eager to hear from you. Until then, stay frosty and treat each other well.
