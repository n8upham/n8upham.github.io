<strong>Teaching philosophy and experience</strong>
</h2>
<p>
I am convinced that there are natural feedbacks between teaching and research that reciprocally benefit student learning and generate novel inquiries. During the process of preparing for lecture, and then again while answering questions, there is a tremendous opportunity for connecting disparate facts and challenging weakly granted assumptions. These are opportunities that are otherwise less frequent for scientists siloed in research-only positions, which may lead them to a higher potential for holding wrong assumptions as truth than their more-regularly teaching colleagues. When lecture concepts can be actively illuminated with examples from the instructor's research, much more straightforward is the connection with students and engagement with knowledge.

In my view, there is no substitute for active <i>in situ</i> learning about the concepts of study while visiting real ecosystems, collecting your own data, and writing your own field notes. Hearing that glacial cycles led to the formation of intermittent lakes is the first step, but visiting the sandy shores of the dry lake bed and envisioning how the waxing and waning waters would have moved those sands over millennia is a more advanced understanding of the truth. In my teaching I aim to be actively engaged in field instruction, whether for short weekend trips to the mountains or deserts as part of a regular lecture course, or multi-week summer field courses involving experiments, data collection, and analysis.

</p #	The foundations laid in class manifest as actual learning most effectively when students can demonstrate to themselves in nature that a concept is so. >
