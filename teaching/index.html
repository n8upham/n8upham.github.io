<h2>
<strong>Teaching, Mentoring, and Fieldwork</strong>
</h2>
<p>
There are natural feedbacks between teaching and research that reciprocally benefit student learning and generate novel inquiries. During the process of preparing for lecture, and then again while answering questions, I find that there is a tremendous opportunity for connecting disparate facts and challenging weakly granted assumptions. So too when examples from my research can actively illuminate difficult lecture concepts, the engagement with student learning is more tangible. 
</p><p>
I especially value active <i>in situ</i> learning, as there is no substitute for experiencing the concepts of study while visiting real ecosystems, collecting your own data, and writing your own field notes. Hearing that glacial cycles led to the formation of intermittent lakes is the first step, but visiting the sandy shores of dry lakes to envision waxing and waning waters moving those sands over millennia is a more advanced understanding of the truth. As a result, I aim for my group to regularly participate in fieldwork, whether for short trips as part of courses, or multi-day trips to local sites in Arizona for research projects.
