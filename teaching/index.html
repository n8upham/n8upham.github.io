<h2>
<strong>Teaching philosophy and experience</strong>
</h2>
<p>
I am convinced that there are natural feedbacks between teaching and research that reciprocally benefit student learning and generate novel inquiries. During the process of preparing for lecture, and then again while answering questions, there is a tremendous opportunity for connecting disparate facts and challenging weakly granted assumptions. So too when examples from the instructor's research can actively illuminate difficult lecture concepts, the engagement between students and knowledge is more straightforward. 
</p><p>
I also value active <i>in situ</i> learning, as there is no substitute for experiencing the concepts of study while visiting real ecosystems, collecting your own data, and writing your own field notes. Hearing that glacial cycles led to the formation of intermittent lakes is the first step, but visiting the sandy shores of the dry lake bed and envisioning waxing and waning waters moving those sands over millennia is a more advanced understanding of the truth. In my teaching I aim to be actively engaged in field instruction, whether for short weekend trips to the mountains or deserts as part of regular lecture courses, or multi-week summer field courses involving experiments, data collection, and analysis.
</p #	The foundations laid in class manifest as actual learning most effectively when students can demonstrate to themselves in nature that a concept is so. >
