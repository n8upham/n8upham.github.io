<h2>"Mammal tree published in PLOS Biology"</h2>
**2019-12-04**

_Hasta la victoria, siempre!_

Excited to have our Mammalia-wide phylogenies now [published in the latest PLOS Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000494) and available for all to use -- these were burning a hole in my laptop for too long!  In the end, we decided to split the [original bioRxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/504803v1) in half, publishing the the methodology for building the new trees separately from the diversification analyses upon the trees.  The latter is still in review, but posted to a [new version on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/504803v3).

Be sure to check out the [Mammals section of the vertlife.org website](http://vertlife.org/data/mammals/), where I created a central explainer and downloader for the data paper.

Also honored that PLOS Biology decided to place our Fig 1 on the [cover of their December 2019 issue](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/image.pbio.v17.i12). The article already has an [Altmetric of 400](https://www.altmetric.com/details/72058161) and [10,000+ views](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000494), which is rewarding after having spent the last 4 years stewarding this project to the finish line.

Gratitude to the 6,069 individual authors of 1,934 published studies on Genbank, and the numerous natural history museums housing those mammal specimens, for contributing the genetic data that enabled this synthetic study.

<h2>"Lights, camera, ... mammals!"</h2>

Aiming to better explain the advantages of our new mammal trees of life, I built these animated GIFs to show the variation in tree topologies and branch lengths across our credible tree sets.

The idea here is that rather than showing one 'best' tree that subsequent comparative methods will assume is the true tree (i.e., known without error), we instead show the probabilistic envelope of reconstructed evolutionary histories.  Our strategy thus reflects the uncertainty inherent in our DNA data, and with efforts to reconstruct the past from the present in general (uncertain models of molecular evolution, incomplete data sampling, etc.).

#### **Movies of the credible sets of Mammalia trees (sample of 100 trees each of 10,000 total)**   
   **NOTE:** For the completed tree sets, the location of the 1813 imputed species are shown (missing DNA; 5911 species total).
