I presented my recent work on global mammal phylogeny at the [10-14 Jan meetings of the American Society of Naturalists](https://amnat2016.org/index.html), held in the beautiful setting of Asilomar, CA.  What a relaxing and clarifying place to discuss evolutionary ideas with luminaries and colleagues alike!

This work builds upon available broadly-sampled DNA markers on NCBI for mammals, with the aim to accurately estimate both branch lengths (time) and species relationships (topology) for all ~5800 extant species.  It forms our first-draft mammal phylogeny (MamPhy v1.0) for the [NSF VertLife grant](https://vertlife.org/), a multi-institutional effort to study evolutionary tempo and mode across global tetrapods.

Here is my title slideâ€” glad to discuss our progress more, just contact me!
