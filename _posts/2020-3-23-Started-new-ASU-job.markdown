Great news amid an otherwise hectic beginning to 2020: I started a new faculty job at Arizona State University! My new title is officially Assistant Research Professor and Associate Curator of Mammals, as affiliated within the [School of Life Sciences](https://sols.asu.edu/) and [Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center](https://biokic.asu.edu/). 

This position is made possible by special initiative funds of the BioKIC for furthering domain-specific goals in integrative taxonomy. My domain of course being mammals! Really excited to jumping into this position, especially with the added stewardship of the [ASU Mammal Collections](https://biokic.asu.edu/collections/mammalogy-collection). Its a small collection of ~9,000 current specimens ([query them in our Symbiota portal here!](https://csvcoll.org/portal/index.php)), but with great potential to grow, especially in association with the new [NEON Biorepository](https://www.neonscience.org/data/samples-specimens/neon-biorepository-asu) being hosted at ASU.

Look for much more from me in regards to the ASU Mammalia collections in the coming months. For now, lets all stay healthy & isolated in this Covid-19 pandemic -- or as ASU President Michael Crow told us: "[Stay frosty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht2RJvc4ExI)"
