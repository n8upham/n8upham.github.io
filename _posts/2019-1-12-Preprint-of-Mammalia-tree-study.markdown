I'm excited to finally share our new study on Mammalia-wide phylogeny and species diversification with a broader audience, which we released as preprint last week: 

**Upham, N. S.**, J. A. Esselstyn, and W. Jetz. 2019. [Ecological causes of uneven diversification and richness in the mammal tree of life.](https://doi.org/10.1101/504803) bioRxiv:504803.

Already, the study has been generating a buzz on Twitter, including [over 4000 engagements on this thread](https://twitter.com/n8_upham/status/1082317979776401409)!  Great to see many people sharing in my excitement about mammal evolution and the potentials for robustly addressing rate-based evolutionary questions with this new supermatrix-based tree of life we generated.

<caption>This is Fig. 1 in the main paper. Species-level relationships and diversification rates across 5911 species of mammals. The branches are colored with tip-level diversification rates (tip DR) and marked with 24 shifts in lineage diversification rates (labels A-X; shifts with multiple circles occurred on either branch, not both; all shifts were detected in â‰¥ 5 of 10 trees analyzed in BAMM (43)). Maximum clade credibility topology of 10,000 trees. Numbered clade labels correspond to orders and subclades listed in the plot periphery: Mars, Marsupialia; X, Xenarthra; Afro, Afrotheria; Laur, Laurasiatheria; Euar, Euarchontoglires. Scale in millions of years, Ma.</caption>
