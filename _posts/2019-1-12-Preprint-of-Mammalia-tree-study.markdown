I'm excited to finally share our new study on Mammalia-wide phylogeny and species diversification with a broader audience, which we released as preprint last week: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Upham, N. S.**, J. A. Esselstyn, and W. Jetz.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ecological causes of uneven diversification and richness in the mammal tree of life.](https://doi.org/10.1101/504803)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bioRxiv:504803.

Already, the study has been generating a buzz on Twitter, including [over 4000 engagements on this thread](https://twitter.com/n8_upham/status/1082317979776401409)!  Great to see many people sharing in my excitement about mammal evolution and the potentials for robustly addressing rate-based evolutionary questions with this new supermatrix-based tree of life we generated.

Here is Fig. 1 in the main paper, showing species-level relationships and diversification rates across 5911 species of mammals. The branches are colored with tip-level diversification rates (tip DR) and marked with 24 shifts in lineage diversification rates.

Even more exciting is the ZOOM-IN version of this tree, where the tip labels are visible with "Genus_species_FAMILY_ORDER" tags consistently displayed throughout.
