As of April 2015, I have a new position as post-doc on the [NSF VertLife Terrestrial grant](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1441737&HistoricalAwards=false), an inter-institutional effort based at [Yale Univ](http://eeb.yale.edu/) in New Haven, CT, USA aiming to reconstruct the evolution and trait diversification of all ~33,000 living species of tetrapods.  This ambitious (!) project is spread across five universities (UC Berkeley, U Florida, George Washington U, Louisiana State U, and Yale) and is partnering with a range of databasing initiatives, including [Map of Life](http://mol.org/) (also based in the [Jetz Lab](http://jetzlab.yale.edu/)) and [AmphibiaWeb](http://amphibiaweb.org/), to facilitate data storage, user-visualization, and consistent formats for ecological and geographic trait data.  

As the sole post-doc on this grant, I am responsible for coordinating communication among team members and labs, and performing analyses of species-level phylogenetics and diversification.  With my background in mammalian ecology and evolution, especially of rodents, I'll be leading the Mammalia components of this tetrapod tree along with [Jake Esselstyn's group](http://www.museum.lsu.edu/esselstyn/) at LSU.  Onward it is!

Update (Sept 2015): Here's our new [grant website](http://vertlife.org/).
