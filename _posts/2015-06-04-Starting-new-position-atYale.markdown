As of April 2015, I have a new position as post-doc on the [NSF VertLife Terrestrial grant](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1441737&HistoricalAwards=false), an inter-institutional effort based at Yale Univ (New Haven, CT, USA) aiming to reconstruct the evolution and trait diversification of all ~33,000 living species of tetrapods.  This ambitious project (!) is spread across five universities (UC Berkeley, U Florida, George Washington U, Louisiana State U, and Yale U) and is partnering with the [Map of Life](http://mol.org/) initiative (also based in the [Jetz Lab](http://jetzlab.yale.edu/)) to facilitate trait data storage, visualization, and sharing.  

As the sole post-doc on this grant, I am responsible for coordinating communication among team members and labs, and performing analyses of phylogeny and diversification.  With my background in the ecology and evolution of mammals, especially rodents, I'll be leading the Mammalia components of this tetrapod tree along with [Jake Esselstyn](http://www.museum.lsu.edu/esselstyn/)'s group at LSU.  Onward it is!

Update (Sept 2015): Here our new [grant website](http://vertlife.org/)
