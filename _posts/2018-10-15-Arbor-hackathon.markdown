I just returned from an awesome weekend at Cornell Univ, where fellow Jetz labbie [Ignacio Quintero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q4J3GXAAAAAJ&hl=en) and I participated in a 'hack-a-thon' for [Arbor Workflows](http://www.arborworkflows.com/), an NSF-funded phylogenetic comparative methods portal created by Luke Harmon, Chelsea Specht, and Bob Thacker.

There were 8 of us hackers invited, and we ended up assembling this [PhyloMancer schema](https://github.com/arborworkflows/phyloMancer) as a way to help guide novel users through model adequacy tests as they build their own workflows.  Beautiful spot that Ithaca!
