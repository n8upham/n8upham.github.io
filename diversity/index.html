<strong>Diversity from field to classroom and museum</strong>
</h1>
<p>

<i>How we treat each other fundamentally matters.</i> This core principle of interrelatedness is why we need to dismantle structural inequalities, which create implicit biases that disproportionately impede the scientific training pipeline for Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and LGBTQ scholars. Recognizing my normative position as a white-passing, heterosexual male has been a key motivation to engage in outreach and mentorship with students from diverse backgrounds in the field, classroom, and museum collections. As a faculty member, my group has promoted opportunities through ASU's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, including the summer <a href="https://biokic.asu.edu/tags/biocollections-dei-scholars-prorgram">Biocollections Scholar Program</a> (biodiversity career experiences to underrepresented students; organized by Kelsey Yule), and the DEI Inclusive Teaching Program (increasing the accessibility of material in the foundational Evolution course that I teach). Prior to coming to ASU, my outreach and mentorship experiences in Chicago Public Schools, at the Field Museum, and in the communities surrounding McMaster and Yale worked to provide supportive models for scientific careers to K-12 students.
