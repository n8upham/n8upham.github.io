<strong>Diversity from field to classroom and museum</strong>
</h1>
<p>

<i>How we treat each other fundamentally matters.</i> This core principle of interrelatedness is why we need to target structural inequalities, which block the scientific training pipeline for Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and LGBTQ students to whom implicit bias disproportionately acts against. Recognizing my normative position as a white-passing, heterosexual male has been a key motivation to engage in outreach and mentorship with students from diverse backgrounds in the field, classroom, and in museum collections. As a faculty member, my group has promoted opportunities through ASU's Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Biocollections Scholar Program, which provides biodiversity career experiences to underrepresented students, and the JEDI Inclusive Teaching Program, which focuses on streamlining material in the foundational Evolution course that I teach. Prior to coming to ASU, my mentorship experiences in Chicago Public Schools, at the Field Museum, and in the communities surrounding McMaster and Yale involved outreach and mentoring to K-12 students to provide supportive models for scientific careers.
