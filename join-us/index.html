<h2><strong>Introduction</h2></strong>

<p>
Super glad that you are interested in the lab.  Please review the lab pages for <a href="https://n8u.org/research/">research</a> and recent <a href="https://n8u.org/pubs/">publications</a> to find out about what we do, how you could learn from joining us, and how you might contribute to our team. 
</p><p>
Our work is primarily <b>question-driven</b> as opposed to by organism or region (though small mammals and Arizona are current favorites), so please think through where your conceptual interests lie relative to the full spread of ecological and evolutionary ideas. Your interests will likely continue to evolve, but having a core basis of curiosity with which to motivate your graduate study is essential for entering our group. Ecologists usually don't get monetarily rich (despite economics being <a href="https://www.ecologicaleconomicsforall.org/ee101">a special category of ecology</a>), so we need to pay ourselves with the satisfaction of loving what we study and becoming skilled at learning new things.
</p>

<h2><strong>Types of questions we ask</h2></strong>
See the <a href="https://n8u.org/research/">Research</a> page, but also:
<p>

<b><i>1. What are the species?</i> (taxonomy and phylogenetics)</b> 
</p><p>
<b><i>2. How fast are lineages evolving?</i> (phylogenetic rates)</b> 
</p><p>
<b><i>3. By what ecological processes?</i> (comparative methods)</b> 

</p>

<h2><strong>Tools we use</h2></strong>

<p>
<b>Mammals</b>

</p><p>
<b>Phylogenetics and Genomics</b>

</p><p>
<b>Statistical modeling</b>


<h2><strong>Systems we investigate</h2></strong>

<p>
<b>Local</b>

</p><p>
<b>Regional</b>

</p><p>
<b>Global</b>

Our lab currently is accepting PhD student applications through the <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/phd-evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary Biology</a> program in the ASU School of Life Sciences (SOLS). We also accept applications for <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/ms-biology--ms">MS in Biology</a> students.  Note that the ASU deadline is <b>1 December</b> annually for applying to these programs. There is also the "4+1" route of an accelerated MS degree if you are a current ASU undergraduate student (details of the latter program <a href="https://acceleratedmasters.asu.edu/how-apply">here</a>). I'd also encourage you to check out the full listing of SOLS graduate programs <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degrees/graduate">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Think broadly, connect disparate ideas, and stay persistant with it. Success is probably more about persistence than anything, but you want the joyful, creative, curious parts of you to be driving that persistence rather than anything external. For that reason, I rank curiosity and enthusiasm highly when evaluating potential lab members <span>&#8212;</span> I have no hope of teaching it; it has to come from inside you. Research experience, analytical skills, and writing ability are also top criteria, but can also be gained. Demonstrated creativity is also a good one <span>&#8212;</span> what have you created / drawn / written lately? Let's talk about it. I want your research projects to excite you and move you to forge a path that will be your own. We might start on a well-worn groove for leaving town, but the many forks in the road will need your persistence and planning to bring us to the next station. Metaphors aside, if you decide to contact me, please take some time and write a thoughtful letter since this more likely to generate a thoughtful response. Please send me your CV and transcripts as appropriate. Tell me about your interests, and why you’re interested in working with our group. Please understand that I may not be able to respond if you don't send these materials. Also, please consider funding or fellowship opportunities, particularly if you’re interested in pursuing a PhD <span>&#8212;</span> for example, the <a href="https://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> or <a href="https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/8-current-fulbrighters/338-phd-info-2">Fulbright foreign program</a> depending on your citizenship. The <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/applicants/types-of-awards/study-research">Fulbright US program</a> also supports periods of international study while at ASU. 
</p>
<p>
I tend not to accept PhD students who haven’t first earned their MS degree, but I will consider exceptional cases. If you are interested in forgoing an MS and working toward your PhD, I will want to see evidence of you have previously planned and completed a big project, preferably that resulted in one or more peer-reviewed publications.
</p>
<p>
If you’re still interested in working with us after reading all this, please <a href="mailto:nathan.upham@asu.edu">send me an email!</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Rock and roll yawl.
