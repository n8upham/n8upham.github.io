<h2><strong>Potential students</h2></strong>

<p>
<i>Come work with us in the Sonoran Desert!</i> 
</p><p>
Fieldwork is foundational to our <b>specimen-based research</b>, which we integrate with genomic, computational, and synthetic approaches to study eco-evolutionary processes. Why specimens? Preserved natural history specimens (including frozen tissues, skins, skeletons, endo-/ecto-parasites, blood, feces, and fluid-preserved whole organisms) are the physical basis for our collective knowledge of Earth's biodiversity. Every data point in public databases like GBIF or GenBank comes from some organism, but only the fraction that are preserved as physical specimens are available for future study. Our lab contributes to growing this 300-year record of the natural world while querying how the biodiversity it represents was generated.

<h2><strong>Introduction</h2></strong>

<p>
Super glad that you are interested in the lab.  Please review the lab pages for <a href="https://n8u.org/research/">research</a> and recent <a href="https://n8u.org/pubs/">publications</a> to find out about what we do, how you could learn from joining us, and how you might contribute to our team.
</p>

<h2><strong>Types of questions we ask</h2></strong>

<p>
<b><i>1. What are the species?</i> (phylogenetics and taxonomy)</b> This question is at the core of all biodiversity science — circumscribing which species are present in a clade / region / community is the baseline for then studying the patterns of  ancestor-to-descendent relationship among those species, and, in turn, the historical processes that resulted in their divergence. Species names are just the beginning: the meaning of names varies widely depending on which data are considered by which authors, so careful data synthesis is often needed. In our lab, we do both <i>species delimitation</i> at a local-to-regional level (e.g., analyses of gene flow, phylogeography) and <i>species synthesis</i> globally (e.g., curating data on genetic relationships, geographic ranges, ecological traits, and their taxonomic history).

</p><p>
<b><i>2. How fast are lineages evolving?</i> (evolutionary rates)</b> Estimating the timing and rates of past evolutionary events allows for then querying which concurrent events or processes have caused apparent rate anomalies. <i>Fossils</i> are the primary means by which we anchor the relative divergence times estimated from  homologous DNA substitutions or morphological changes. Mammals, and especially rodents, have well-studied fossil records that allow us to reliably root our genomic analyses in the absolute timescale of earth-history events. In our lab, we commonly investigate rates of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution and their population-level components of gene flow or isolation that impact these rates.

</p><p>
<b><i>3. By what ecological processes?</i> (comparative methods)</b> Species interactions with other organisms (biotic) or the environment (abiotic) are at the core of what our lab aims to investigate, but we recognize that doing so requires reliable answers to questions 1 and 2 above. For this reason, we move forward on all three questions jointly, using an iterative approach to advance the field in all areas. In our lab, we are focusing on two main areas currently:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Host-pathogen dynamics.</i> Which mammal species have which viral, bacterial, and fungal symbionts? How are pathogens shared among species, and how do pathogen networks relate to risks of wildlife spillover to humans? We are studying these processes at both local scales in Arizona and at synthetic scales across clades of global mammals.
		</li>
		<li><i>Intrinsic species-level traits.</i> How do traits like living underground, or flying, or having 12 mammae instead of 4 influence rates of gene flow or isolation and ultimately trends of speciation and extinction? We are currently studying these dynamics among global mammals, but there is ample fodder for more regional investigations.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2><strong>Contact me</h2></strong>

<p>
Currently, my lab is accepting PhD student applications through the <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/phd-evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary Biology</a> program in the ASU School of Life Sciences (SOLS). I also accept applications for <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/ms-biology--ms">MS in Biology</a> students.  Note that the ASU deadline is <b>1 December</b> annually for applying to these programs. There is also the "4+1" route of an accelerated MS degree if you are a current ASU undergraduate student (details of the latter program <a href="https://acceleratedmasters.asu.edu/how-apply">here</a>>). I'd also encourage you to check out the full listing of SOLS graduate programs <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/degrees/graduate">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I place a premium on curiosity, enthusiasm, research experience, analytical skills, writing ability, and creativity. If and when you decide to contact me, please take some time and write a thoughtful letter (because this is more likely to generate a thoughtful response). Please send me your CV and transcripts as appropriate. Tell me a bit about your interests, and why you’re interested in working with our group. Please understand that I may not be able to respond if you don't send these materials. Also, it bodes well if you’ve looked into a funding source or two, particularly if you’re interested in conducting dissertation work (e.g., the <a href="https://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> or <a href="https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/8-current-fulbrighters/338-phd-info-2">Fulbright foreign program</a> depending on your citizenship; the <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/applicants/types-of-awards/study-research">Fulbright US program</a> also supports periods of international study while at ASU). 
</p>
<p>
I tend not to accept PhD students who haven’t first earned their MS degree, but I will consider exceptional cases. If you are interested in forgoing an MS and working toward your PhD, I will prefer seeing some evidence of your ability to see something through from start to finish, preferably in the form of one or more peer-reviewed publications.
</p>
<p>
If you’re still interested in working with us after reading this far, please send me an email (<a href="mailto:nathan.upham@asu.edu">nathan [dot] upham [at] asu [dot] edu</a>). 
</p>
<p>
I'm eager to hear from you. Until then, stay frosty and treat each other well.
