<strong>Research framework</strong>
</h2>
<p>
The questions motivating my research program extend across scales from local populations to regional clades of species to ask how processes of gene flow and selection change through time to influence species birth, death, and adaptation. The spectacular gradients of biodiversity we observe in modern habitats—from the tropics to the poles, across elevations, and between diverse and depauperate lineages of organism—are the current products of spatial and temporal variances in the balance of speciation, extinction, and dispersal.

Yet those processes of diversification are neither well understood (i) in a descriptive context, in terms of rates and magnitudes of change across regions and clades; nor (ii) in a causal context, in terms of their underlying ecological and historical drivers. To what extent do evolutionary rate variations follow ecological and geographic rules across the tree of life? What are the relative roles of contingent events (e.g., long-distance dispersal, area of endemism) and environmental interactions (both biotic and abiotic) as drivers of species diversification and trait adaptation? I address these questions by integrating genomic, paleontological, and bioinformatic tools to study clades of mammals, notably rodents, as they are particularly well matched to studying ecological diversification and are directly relevant to human health and economic goals (e.g., as disease reservoirs and seed dispersers). 
</p><p>
At the center of these efforts are timetrees, i.e., time-calibrated molecular phylogenies detailing evolutionary hypotheses for the branching relationships among species through time. Geological ages, especially from fossils, are essential for scaling relative rates of molecular substitution to time, a key step that allows disparate evolutionary processes to be compared under the common framework of temporal rates. This primacy of fossil data integration therefore suggests the need to target fossil-rich lineages for studying the tempo and mode of diversification, among which Mammalia stands out as exceptional. Diverse radiations of rodents have been focal for several components of my research program, which are detailed below.

Projects focusing on the rodent clade Caviomorpha (guinea pigs, spiny rats, and their relatives; ~250 living species) are the center of my ongoing studies of evolutionary rates and their underlying drivers. As the first rodent lineage to reach South America, caviomorphs are a fascinating example of a continental radiation that took place without close coexisting relatives. To what extent did that ecological opportunity influence their tempo and mode of trait adaptation and species diversification? The well-studied Cenozoic fossil record of caviomorphs is a key asset is this research, and was a primary draw for me to begin these studies.

<h3><i>In North American deserts – [regional-scale; heteromyid and cricetid rodents]
</h3></i>
<p>
My early work on projects in the Great Basin Desert focused on questions of population genetics, biogeography, and behavioral ecology that I have since built upon. That early fieldwork in search of elusive kangaroo mice (Microdipodops) revealed the striking diversity of nocturnal rodents inhabiting sagebrush steppe, and demonstrated to me key concepts of niche partitioning, habitat specialization, and how species assemble in rank-abundance hierarchies. In lab, our phylogeographic work revealed five genetic units of at least 3-million years divergence within the then-two recognized species of kangaroo mice. Historical gene flow from south-to-north suggested range expansion from glacial refugia, but the pre-Pleistocene divergences among phylogeographic units implied older barriers to gene flow.

In a related project that leveraged our rodent activity data from seven years of Great Basin trapping, I investigated the influence of moon brightness and phase on trap success of nocturnal species to test the hypothesis of moonlight avoidance (2013 J MAMM). I found evidence contrary to the common notion that all desert rodents reduce their moonlight activity to avoid predators. Instead, kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) appeared to drive that pattern, avoiding moonlight while other groups of rodents either did not respond or in some cases increased their open-area activity, possibly as a form of release from the competitively dominant kangaroo rats.
