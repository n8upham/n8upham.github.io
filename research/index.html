<strong>Research framework</strong>

The questions motivating my research program extend across scales from local populations to regional clades of species to ask how processes of gene flow and selection change through time to influence species birth, death, and adaptation. The spectacular gradients of biodiversity we observe in modern habitats—from the tropics to the poles, across elevations, and between diverse and depauperate lineages of organism—are the current products of spatial and temporal variances in the balance of speciation, extinction, and dispersal.

Yet those processes of diversification are neither well understood (i) in a descriptive context, in terms of rates and magnitudes of change across regions and clades; nor (ii) in a causal context, in terms of their underlying ecological and historical drivers. To what extent do evolutionary rate variations follow ecological and geographic rules across the tree of life? What are the relative roles of contingent events (e.g., long-distance dispersal, area of endemism) and environmental interactions (both biotic and abiotic) as drivers of species diversification and trait adaptation? I address these questions by integrating genomic, paleontological, and bioinformatic tools to study clades of mammals, notably rodents, as they are particularly well matched to studying ecological diversification and are directly relevant to human health and economic goals (e.g., as disease reservoirs and seed dispersers).

At the center of these efforts are timetrees, i.e., time-calibrated molecular phylogenies detailing evolutionary hypotheses for the branching relationships among species through time. Geological ages, especially from fossils, are essential for scaling relative rates of molecular substitution to time, a key step that allows disparate evolutionary processes to be compared under the common framework of temporal rates. This primacy of fossil data integration therefore suggests the need to target fossil-rich lineages for studying the tempo and mode of diversification, among which Mammalia stands out as exceptional. Diverse radiations of rodents have been focal for several components of my research program, which are detailed below.
