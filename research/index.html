<h2>
<strong>Research framework</strong>
</h2>
<p>
Variances in speciation, extinction, and dispersal produce the spectacular gradients of biodiversity we observe today – from the tropics to the poles, over elevations, and between diverse and depauperate lineages of organism. However, the extents to which determinism (e.g., time), contingency (e.g., long-distance dispersal), and species-to-environment interactions have driven species-level radiations across the tree of life are largely unknown. The critical need to understand biodiversity – and its origins and maintenance through the Anthropocene – leads me to query how biodiversification ‘works’, both <i>descriptively</i>, for the rates of evolutionary change across regions and clades, and <i>causally</i>, for the underlying drivers of rate variation. 
</p><p>
I address these questions by integrating across DNA, fossil, and ecological data types, I seek to understand ‘how we got here’ in eco-evolutionary terms, and ‘what to do now’ in terms of humanity’s sustainable actions. Mammals (especially rodents) are central to my specimen-based research because they are not only diverse as fossils and living organisms, but directly relevant to humans as disease reservoirs, seed dispersers, and by common ancestry.
</p><p>
At the center of these efforts are timetrees, i.e., time-calibrated molecular phylogenies detailing evolutionary hypotheses for the branching relationships among species through time. Geological ages, especially from fossils, are essential for scaling relative rates of molecular substitution to time, a key step that allows disparate evolutionary processes to be compared under a common temporal framework.

<h2>
<strong>RE-IMAGINING IN PROGRESS</strong>
<p>It's been two eventful years since I re-thought my research trajectory &mdash including the publication of a new Mammalia-wide phylogeny, exciting new work on mammal host-virus ecological interactions, and innovative new ways of thinking about taxonomic concepts from the perspective of empirical data (range maps, verified DNA sequences) &mdash so place check back soon while I chart a new course.
</p>
<p> Until then, here is the zoomable beauty of evolutionary relationships </p>
