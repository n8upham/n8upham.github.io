<h2>
<strong>Research framework</strong>
</h2>
<p>
Variances in speciation, extinction, and dispersal produce the spectacular gradients of biodiversity we observe today – from the tropics to the poles, over elevations, and between diverse and depauperate lineages of organism. However, the extents to which determinism (e.g., time), contingency (e.g., long-distance dispersal), and species-to-environment interactions have driven species-level radiations across the tree of life are largely unknown. The critical need to understand biodiversity – and its origins and maintenance through the Anthropocene – leads me to query how biodiversification ‘works’, both <i>descriptively</i>, for the rates of evolutionary change across regions and clades, and <i>causally</i>, for the underlying drivers of rate variation. 
</p><p>
I address these questions by integrating across DNA, fossil, and ecological data types, I seek to understand ‘how we got here’ in eco-evolutionary terms, and ‘what to do now’ in terms of humanity’s sustainable actions. Mammals (especially rodents) are central to my specimen-based research because they are not only diverse as fossils and living organisms, but directly relevant to humans as disease reservoirs, seed dispersers, and by common ancestry.
</p><p>
At the center of these efforts are timetrees, i.e., time-calibrated molecular phylogenies detailing evolutionary hypotheses for the branching relationships among species through time. Geological ages, especially from fossils, are essential for scaling relative rates of molecular substitution to time, a key step that allows disparate evolutionary processes to be compared under a common temporal framework.

<strong>RE-IMAGINING IN PROGRESS</strong>
<p>I am taking a short break to re-think my research trajectory &#8212 which now spans from Mammalia-wide phylogenetics to exciting new work on mammal host-virus ecological interactions, and innovative ideas for using geospatial and genetic data to represent taxonomic concepts in databases &#8212 so please be patient while I chart a new course over the next couple weeks.
</p>
<p> Until then, imagine the possibilities of a globally linked mammal biodiversity knowledge graph—in space and time— along with me...

You can also download the <a href="https://n8upham.github.io/images/FigS12_annotated.pdf" download>ZOOM-IN</a> version of this tree, where the tip labels are visible with "Genus_species_FAMILY_ORDER" tags consistently displayed throughout.
